# Actiaug

[![Tests](https://github.com/Trybnetic/actiaug/actions/workflows/python-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Trybnetic/actiaug/actions/workflows/python-test.yml)

`actiaug` (short for activity augmentation) is an extension of the [tsaug](https://github.com/arundo/tsaug) package. 
Additional to the base functionality, it offers acceleration-specific augmentation methods that are useful when working
with accelerometer-measured time series. As these augmentations are application-specific, this package was forked from
the original package.
